# Linda's Restaurant Review App

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, a static webpage was given to the students to convert to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, The page lacks accessibility and student's need to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use, as well as a service worker will also be added to create a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Required features

- responsive design
- accessibility 
- offline use

## Local usage

- Start up a simple HTTP server (like Python) to serve up the site files on your local computer
- If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software
- Navigate to the project folder
- In a terminal, check the version of Python you have with the `python -V` code.
- If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
- For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Now with your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`

### Audits
